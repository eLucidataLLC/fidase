Historical aerial photographs: Images taken by Falkland Islands Dependencies Aerial Survey Expedition (FIDASE) on the 31st January 1957 were digitally scanned and geo-referenced to the WorldView-2 data. They were then divided into polygons and analysed using manual classification processing using the open source QGIS software.

### Falkland Islands and Dependencies Aerial Survey Expedition

This comprises approximately 12,800 frames, taken on 26,700 kilometres of ground track. The photography was acquired between February 1956 and December 1957. The images are vertical, monochrome photographs in the standard 9" x 9" format; some small format (5" x 5") oblique photographs are also available for a restricted geographical coverage. The original negatives are held by BAS. The photography provides systematic coverage of the South Shetland Islands and the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula as far south as the northern extremity of Marguerite Bay.

Flight-line index maps are available for most of the coverage. For details of holdings of a particular area, please contact:
